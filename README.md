## Installation
This code has a number of required dependencies which have to be pre-installed to work. They include:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn

Also need to download and save the 2017 and 2022 stackoverflow developer survey reponses which can be found [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) These should be saved as "public_survey_results_2017" and "public_survey_results_2022" respectively. 

## Motivation 
The motivation behind this project was to analyse the diversity of the respondents to the stack overflow surveys in 2017 and 2022. Through this hopefully we can get indications on the diversity of the developer workforce and the progress it is making. It focuses on gender and ethnicity and looks at their representation, the representation amongst the top earners and salary expectations. 

## Files 
Jupyter notebook including the code used to run the analysis: ProjectCode (3).ipynb


## Usage
Download survey responses before use as stated in installation instructions. 
Code is commented and split into clear sections to allow ease of use. All parts should-be self explanatory. All contributions are welcome using the existing files (or added more recent surveys) to allow further analysis and insights to be given.
